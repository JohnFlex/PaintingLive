# PaintingLive
A program that let you paint in AR with HoloLens

*Here I would have some screenshots. Have some of them ? Send me <3*

## Description

Once you have the application on your HoloLens, you just have click to send balls that will explode once they touch a wall.

## Installation Guide 

#### Requirements 

You'll need
* Unity 2018.3.14f1
  * UWP Build Support (IL2CPP) module
  * UWP Build Support (.NET) module
* Visual Studio Community 2017
  * UWP Component 
  * __VC++ Toolset individual component__

Either, I'm not sure if it will be enough. Try to install C++ Desktop and .NET components.

#### Installation

* Connect your HoloLens
* Launch *PaintingLive.sln*
* Change solution platform to *x86* and *Simulator* to *Device*
* Take a coffee 

And it's done !

If you plug the HoloLens for the first time, you'll need to connect it by giving a code provided by developpers options.

## Changelog

Warning : This version is not tested yet. I'm not sure if it will work.
